## Instructions
This is a classic game where you match two tiles, and the aim is to finish whole stack by doing least moves. It requires good memory skill.

This game implementation counts the number of moves done by the user, seconds elapsed until the game started. It shows this information in a leaderboard when user wins a game. User can choose to reset the game any time.
